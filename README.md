# Discord Nitro Code Generator
This program Generates a specified amount of Discord nitro codes/links and saves them to a .txt file.

I made this years ago, but aside from the program itself looking slightly messy there shouldn't be any functional issues.
Running the .exe is the easiest way to use this, but you can run the .py script if you'd rather (and therefore modify it to your liking.)

Obviously, the codes are not guaranteed to be valid.
